Sociology is the scientific and systematic study of groups and group interactions, societies and social interactions,from small and personal groups to very large groups.A group of people who live in a defined geographic area, who interact with one another,and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society.

Sociologists study allaspects and levels of society.Sociologists working from the micro-level study small groups and individual interactions, while those using macro-level analysis look at trends among and between large groups and societies. For example, a micro-level study might look at the accepted rules of conversation in various groups such as among teenagers or business professionals. In contrast,a macro-level analysis might research the ways that language use has changed over time or in social media outlets.

The term culture refers to the group's shared practices, values, and beliefs.Culture encompasses agroup'sway of life,fromroutine,everyday interactions to themost important parts of group members'lives.It includes everything produced by a society,including allthe social rules.

Sociologists often study culture using the sociological imagination, which pioneer sociologist C. Wright Mils described as an awareness of the relationship between a person's behavior and experience and the wider culture that shaped the person's choices and perceptions.It's a way of seeing our own and other people's behavior in relationship to history and social structure (1959). One illustration of this is a person's decision to marry.In the United States,this choice is heavily influenced by individual feelings. However, the social acceptability of marriage relative to the person's circumstances also plays a part.

Remember,though, that culture is a product of the people in a society. Sociologists take care not to treat the concept of “culture"as though it were alive and real.The error of treating an abstract concept as though it has a real, material existence is known as reification (Sahn, 2013).

# Studying Patterns: How Sociologists View Society

All sociologists are interested in the experiences of individuals and how those experiences are shaped by interactions with social groups and society.To a sociologist,the personal decisions an individual makes do not exist in a vacuum. Cultural patterns, social forces and influences put pressure on people to select one choice over another. Sociologists try to identify these general patterns by examining the behavior of large groups of people living in the same society and experiencing the same societal pressures.

Consider the changes in U.S. families. The “typical" family in past decades consisted of married parents living in a home with their unmarried children. Today, the percent of unmarred couples, same-sex couples,single-parent and single-adult households is increasing, as wellas is the number of expanded households, in which extended family members such as grandparents, cousins, or adult children live together in the family home. While 15 millon mothers still make up the majority of single parents, 3.5 mlion fathers are also raising their children alone (U.S. Census Bureau,2O2O). Increasingly,single people and cohabitating couples are choosing to raise children outside of marriage through surrogates or adoption.

Some sociologists study social facts-the laws, morals, values,religious beliefs, customs, fashions, rituals, and cultural rules that govern socialife一that may contribute to these changes in the family. Do people in the United States view marriage and family differently over the years? Do they view them differently than Peruvians? Do employment and economic conditions play a role in families? Other sociologists are studying the consequences of these new patterns, such as the ways children influence and are influenced by them and/or the changing needs for education, housing,and healthcare.

Sociologists identify and study patterns related to allkinds of contemporary social issues. The “Stop and Frisk" policy, the emergence of new political factions,how Twitter influences everyday communication-these are all examples of topics that sociologists might explore.

# Studying Part and Whole: How Sociologists View Social Structures

A key component of the sociological perspective is the idea that the individual and society are inseparable.It is impossible to study one without the other. German sociologist Norbert Elias called the process of simultaneously analyzing the behavior of individuals and the society that shapes that behavior figuration.

Consider religion. While people experience religion in a distinctly individual manner, religion exists in a larger social context as a social institution.For instance,an individual's religious practice may be influenced by what government dictates, holidays, teachers, places of worship, rituals, and so on.These influences underscore the important relationship between individual practices of religion and social pressures that influence that religious experience (Elias, 1978). In simpler terms, figuration means that as one analyzes the social institutions in a society,the individuals using that institution in any fashion need to be ‘figured' in to the analysis.

# SOCIOLOGY INTHEREALWORLD

# Individual-Society Connections

When sociologist Nathan Kierns spoke to his friend Ashley (a pseudonym) about the move she and her partner had made from an urban center to a small Midwestern town, he was curious about how the social pressures placed on a lesbian couple differed from one community to the other. Ashley said that in the city they had been accustomed to getting looks and hearing comments when she and her partner walked hand in hand. Otherwise, she felt that they were at least being tolerated. There had been little to no outright discrimination.

Things changed when they moved to the small town for her partner's job. For the first time,Ashley found herself experiencing direct discrimination because of her sexual orientation. Some of it was particularly hurtful. Landlords would not rent to them. Ashley, who is a highly trained professional, had a great deal of difficulty finding a new job.

When Nathan asked Ashley if she and her partner became discouraged or bitter about this new situation, Ashley said that rather than letting it get to them, they decided to do something about it. Ashley approached groups at a local college and several churches in the area. Together they decided to form the town's first Gay-Straight Alliance.

The alliance has worked successfully to educate their community about same-sex 保存uples.It also worked to raise awareness about the kinds of discrimination that Ashley and her partner experienced in the town and how those could be eliminated. The alliance has become a strong advocacy group,and it is working to attain equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, or LGBTQ individuals.

Kierns observed that this is an excellent example of how negative social forces can result in a positive response from individuals to bring about social change (Kierns, 2011).
